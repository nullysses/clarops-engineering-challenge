# Distributed Event Watchdog Challenge

## Context

In Clarops, some operational flows are distributed across multiple services. Each service may emit events when it completes an action. In many cases, after one event is received, another event is expected to arrive within a specific time window.

The goal of this challenge is to build a small service that receives distributed events, tracks the state of a flow by `traceId`, and reports whether the flow is started, waiting for another event, completed, or expired because an expected event did not arrive within the configured TTL.

This challenge is intentionally small in scope, but some requirements are intentionally open. We want to understand how you analyze ambiguity, define assumptions, split development work into tasks, use AI tools, and make technical decisions.

You may use AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Copilot, or similar.

---

## Running the Project

For setup and run instructions see **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**.

---

## Expected Duration

This challenge is designed to be completed in **3 to 4 hours**.

We do not expect a production-ready system. We expect a clear, functional MVP with good analysis, documented trade-offs, meaningful tests, and a reasonable implementation.

---

## Repository Notes

The repository already includes the base setup required to run with:

- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- Basic application structure
- Database connectivity
- An existing endpoint that reads information from the database

You should build your solution on top of the existing project.

You do **not** need to add Kafka, SQS, Pub/Sub, Flyway, Liquibase, Docker, or any external event infrastructure.

---

# Goal

Build a service with two endpoints:

```
POST /events
GET /traces/{traceId}/status
```

The service must:

1. Receive events associated with a `traceId`.
2. Track the current state of the distributed flow.
3. Allow an event to define the next expected event and the TTL to wait for it.
4. Allow an event to indicate that the flow has finished.
5. Return the current status of the flow by `traceId`.
6. Detect TTL expiration when the expected next event does not arrive on time.

---

# Functional Requirements

## 1. Receive Events

The service must expose:

```
POST /events
```

This endpoint receives an event related to a distributed flow.

### Request Body Contract

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt-001",
  "traceId": "trace-123",
  "eventName": "APPLICATION_RECEIVED",
  "result": "SUCCESS",
  "occurredAt": "2026-06-15T10:00:00Z",
  "nextExpectedEvent": "RULES_EVALUATED",
  "nextEventTtlSeconds": 120,
  "finalEvent": false,
  "metadata": {
    "country": "MX",
    "entityId": "company-123"
  }
}
```

### Field Description

|         Field         |   Type   | Required |                            Description                             |
|-----------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `eventId`             | string   | Yes      | Unique identifier of the event.                                    |
| `traceId`             | string   | Yes      | Identifier of the distributed flow.                                |
| `eventName`           | string   | Yes      | Name of the event being reported.                                  |
| `result`              | string   | Yes      | Result of the event. Allowed values: `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`.           |
| `occurredAt`          | datetime | Yes      | Date and time when the event occurred.                             |
| `nextExpectedEvent`   | string   | No       | Name of the next event expected for this trace.                    |
| `nextEventTtlSeconds` | number   | No       | Maximum number of seconds to wait for the next expected event.     |
| `finalEvent`          | boolean  | No       | Indicates whether this event completes the flow. Default: `false`. |
| `metadata`            | object   | No       | Flexible metadata associated with the event.                       |

---

## 2. Query Trace Status

The service must expose:

```
GET /traces/{traceId}/status
```

This endpoint returns the current state of the flow associated with the given `traceId`.

The status must be calculated based on the received events and the TTL of the next expected event.

The service does **not** need to implement a scheduler or background job. TTL expiration may be evaluated when the status endpoint is called.

---

# Trace Statuses

The service must support the following statuses:

|         Status          |                                               Description                                                |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `STARTED`               | The first event was received, but there is no next expected event defined and the flow is not completed. |
| `WAITING_OTHER_EVENT`   | The latest event defined a next expected event and its TTL has not expired yet.                          |
| `TTL_EXPIRED_FOR_EVENT` | The expected next event did not arrive before the configured TTL expired.                                |
| `COMPLETED`             | A received event marked the flow as completed using `finalEvent = true`.                                 |

---

# Status Response Contract

The exact response structure is part of the design you must define.

However, the response should include enough information to understand the current state of the trace, such as:

```json
{
  "traceId": "trace-123",
  "status": "WAITING_OTHER_EVENT",
  "lastEventName": "APPLICATION_RECEIVED",
  "lastEventResult": "SUCCESS",
  "nextExpectedEvent": "RULES_EVALUATED",
  "nextExpectedBefore": "2026-06-15T10:02:00Z",
  "eventsReceived": 1
}
```

You may add or remove fields if your design justifies it. Please document your decision.

---

# Expected Behavior

## First Event

When the first event for a `traceId` is received, the service must create the trace state.

The resulting status depends on the event:

- If the event defines a next expected event and TTL, the trace should move to `WAITING_OTHER_EVENT`.
- If the event does not define a next expected event and is not final, the trace should remain in `STARTED`.
- If the event is marked as final, the trace should move to `COMPLETED`.

---

## Waiting for Another Event

When an event defines `nextExpectedEvent` and `nextEventTtlSeconds`, the trace should wait for that event until the TTL expires.

You must decide and document how the TTL is calculated.

For example, you may calculate it from:

- `occurredAt`
- the time the service received the event
- another approach you consider better for this MVP

---

## Expected Event Arrives

If the next received event matches the expected event, the trace should advance.

The new event may:

- define another expected event;
- complete the flow;
- leave the flow in another valid state according to your design.

---

## TTL Expiration

If the expected event does not arrive within the configured TTL, the trace status must be reported as:

```
TTL_EXPIRED_FOR_EVENT
```

A real alerting system is not required. For this MVP, the expired status is enough to represent the alert.

---

## Final Event

If an event is received with `finalEvent = true`, the trace must be marked as:

```
COMPLETED
```

A completed trace should not be reported as expired.

---

## Event Result

The event result must support:

```
SUCCESS
ERROR
```

The `result` indicates the outcome of the event, not necessarily the overall status of the trace.

For example, a flow may be completed with a final event whose result is `ERROR`.

---

# Database Requirement

You must define the database schema required for your solution.

One of your development tasks must be:

> Define the DDL for the data model and include the initialization script inside the `docker/init-scripts/db/` folder.

You do **not** need to use Flyway, Liquibase, or any similar migration tool. A plain SQL initialization script is enough.

Your schema should support the behavior required by the challenge. You are expected to make and document your own decisions regarding:

- tables;
- columns;
- constraints;
- indexes;
- whether to store event history, current trace state, or both;
- how to store `metadata`.

---

# Open Questions

Some requirements are intentionally open. You are expected to identify them, make reasonable decisions, and document your assumptions.

Please include these decisions in your `README.md`.

Examples of open questions:

1. What should happen if the same `eventId` is received more than once?
2. What should happen if an event arrives with a different `eventName` than the currently expected event?
3. What should happen if the expected event arrives after the TTL already expired?
4. Should TTL be calculated from `occurredAt` or from the time the event was received by the service?
5. Should a completed trace accept more events?
6. What should happen if the first event is also a final event?
7. What should happen if an event with `result = ERROR` defines a next expected event?
8. Should `metadata` be stored as JSON, structured columns, or ignored?
9. How should the service avoid inconsistent trace states?
10. What should be returned when querying a `traceId` that does not exist?

There is no single correct answer for all of these. We care about your reasoning, trade-offs, and implementation quality.

---

---

Submission Instructions

# TASKS.md Requirement

The `TASKS.md` file is important.

We want to understand how you split the problem before implementing it, especially if you use an LLM to help you write the code.

A good task breakdown should avoid vague instructions such as:

```
Implement the whole challenge.
```

or:

```
Create the watchdog service.
```

Those tasks are too broad and may cause an LLM to infer too much, spend more time, produce unnecessary code, or use more tokens than needed.

Instead, prefer small and explicit tasks.

Example:

```markdown
# Tasks

## Task 1 — Define data model and DDL

- Define the tables required to support the solution.
- Define constraints and indexes.
- Add SQL initialization script under `docker/init-scripts/db/`.

## Task 2 — Implement event ingestion contract

- Create the request contract for `POST /events`.
- Validate required fields.
- Persist the received event.
- Create or update trace state.

## Task 3 — Implement trace status logic

- Implement the logic to return `STARTED`, `WAITING_OTHER_EVENT`, `TTL_EXPIRED_FOR_EVENT`, or `COMPLETED`.
- Define how TTL is calculated.
- Document edge-case decisions.

## Task 4 — Implement status endpoint

- Create `GET /traces/{traceId}/status`.
- Return the current trace state.
- Handle unknown `traceId`.

## Task 5 — Add tests

- Add unit tests for the core state transition logic.
- Add Hurl tests for at least two end-to-end scenarios.
```

You may define your own tasks. The important part is that they are clear, scoped, and useful for development.

---

# Unit Tests Requirement

You must include unit tests.

We do not expect unit tests to be randomly selected by an LLM. We expect you to define a clear testing standard and then use it consistently.

Your unit tests should focus on the core business logic, especially:

- first event creates the trace state;
- event with next expected event moves the trace to `WAITING_OTHER_EVENT`;
- TTL expiration returns `TTL_EXPIRED_FOR_EVENT`;
- final event moves the trace to `COMPLETED`;
- duplicate event behavior, if you choose to support it;
- late event behavior, if you choose to support it.

You do not need to test every possible edge case. We care more about whether your tests are meaningful, consistent, and aligned with your decisions.

---

## Unit Test Prompt Requirement

If you use AI to define or generate unit tests, you must include the prompt you used in `AI_USAGE.md`.

The prompt should define a testing standard. It should not simply ask the LLM to “write any tests”.

Avoid prompts like:

```
Write unit tests for this service.
```

Prefer prompts that define clear expectations, for example:

```
Define unit tests for the Event Watchdog state transition service.

Use the following standard:
- Test method names should follow: shouldExpectedBehavior_WhenCondition.
- Each test should validate one business rule only.
- Use Arrange / Act / Assert structure.
- Avoid testing framework or Spring wiring unless necessary.
- Focus on state transitions, TTL expiration, final event behavior, duplicate events, and late events.
- Do not add tests for behavior not defined in the challenge unless clearly marked as an assumption.
- For every test, explain which requirement or assumption it validates.
```

You may use your own standard. The important part is that your prompt makes the expected testing style explicit.

---

# E2E Validation with Hurl

The Hurl tests are part of the official validation criteria for this challenge.

We will use the Hurl end-to-end tests to validate the expected use cases implemented by the candidate. These tests are expected to run successfully in **100% of the covered scenarios**.

The goal of the Hurl tests is to validate the service from the outside, using the public HTTP contract, not internal implementation details.

The Hurl tests should validate behavior through the public HTTP API:

```
POST /events
GET /traces/{traceId}/status
```

Do not rely on direct database queries for Hurl validation unless you clearly justify it.

---

## Required Hurl Coverage

At minimum, the Hurl tests must cover:

1. A trace that starts and reaches `STARTED`.
2. A trace that moves to `WAITING_OTHER_EVENT`.
3. A trace that reaches `COMPLETED`.
4. A trace that reaches `TTL_EXPIRED_FOR_EVENT`.

If your implementation includes additional decisions, such as duplicate event handling, late event handling, or unexpected event handling, please include Hurl tests for those scenarios as well.

A suggested folder structure is:

```
hurl/
  started-flow.hurl
  waiting-other-event-flow.hurl
  completed-flow.hurl
  ttl-expired-flow.hurl
```

Please include instructions in the README explaining how to run the Hurl tests.

Example:

```bash
hurl --test hurl/*.hurl
```

---

# AI-Assisted Implementation

You may use AI tools freely to implement this challenge.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- data model design;
- DDL definition;
- Spring components;
- controllers;
- services;
- repositories;
- DTOs;
- unit tests;
- Hurl scripts;
- documentation;
- refactoring;
- debugging.

Using AI is allowed and expected.

However, the candidate is responsible for understanding the final solution.

During the technical interview, we may ask questions about any part of the implementation, including:

- why the data model was designed that way;
- why certain tables, columns, constraints, or indexes were created;
- why a specific state transition was implemented;
- how TTL expiration is calculated;
- how duplicate events are handled;
- how late events are handled;
- how unexpected events are handled;
- why certain unit tests were included or excluded;
- why the Hurl scenarios were selected;
- how the implementation would change with more time;
- what parts were generated by AI and what parts were manually adjusted.

The purpose is not to penalize AI usage. The purpose is to understand whether the candidate can reason about what the LLM produced and whether they can explain, validate, and challenge the generated code.

Generated code is acceptable. Unexplained generated code is not.

>
> Validate only public API responses. Do not assert internal database details.

## Accepted Suggestions

- Example: Using lazy TTL evaluation in the status endpoint.
- Example: Storing event metadata as JSON.

## Rejected Suggestions

- Example: Kafka-based implementation, because the challenge does not require real event infrastructure.
- Example: Scheduler-based expiration, because lazy evaluation is enough for the MVP.

## Manual Decisions

- Example: TTL is calculated from `occurredAt`.
- Example: Duplicate `eventId` returns a conflict response.
- Example: A completed trace does not accept new events.

# Interview Follow-up

After submitting the challenge, the technical interview may include questions about the implementation.

The interviewer may ask the candidate to explain:

- a specific class, function, or state transition;
- a DDL decision;
- a unit test;
- a Hurl scenario;
- a prompt used to generate part of the solution;
- a trade-off documented in the README;
- an edge case that was intentionally left out;
- how the implementation would evolve with more time.

The goal is to evaluate how the candidate works with AI-generated code, how they review it, how they reason about it, and whether they can take ownership of the final solution.

# Final Notes

Keep the solution simple.

We are not looking for a perfect event-driven platform. We are looking for a small and thoughtful implementation that shows how you reason about distributed events, TTL expiration, ambiguous requirements, database modeling, AI-assisted development, task decomposition, and testing standards.

## Problem Understanding

The service receives events belonging to distributed flows identified by `traceId`. Each accepted event may:

* leave the trace active without another expected event;
* define the next expected event and its TTL;
* complete the trace.

The service persists event history and enough current trace state to answer status queries efficiently. TTL expiration is evaluated when the status endpoint is called; no scheduler or background process is required.

The supported trace statuses are:

* `STARTED`
* `WAITING_OTHER_EVENT`
* `TTL_EXPIRED_FOR_EVENT`
* `COMPLETED`

## Assumptions and Behavioral Decisions

### TTL calculation

TTL is calculated from the time the service accepts the event, not from the client-provided `occurredAt`.

This avoids clock-skew and delayed-delivery problems affecting operational deadlines.

A trace is expired when:

```text
currentTime >= nextExpectedBefore
```

### Event ordering

Events are processed in service-arrival order.

`occurredAt` is retained as event information but does not determine state-transition order.

### Duplicate events

`eventId` is globally unique.

* An exact duplicate is treated as an idempotent request and does not increment the event count or modify trace state.
* Reusing an `eventId` with different content returns `409 Conflict`.

### Unexpected events

When a trace is waiting for a specific event, another event name is rejected with `409 Conflict`.

The rejected event is not persisted and does not modify trace state.

### Late events

If the expected event arrives at or after its deadline, it is rejected with `409 Conflict`.

The trace remains expired and is not automatically revived.

### Completed traces

A first event may also be a final event.

After completion:

* exact duplicate events remain idempotent;
* new events are rejected with `409 Conflict`;
* the trace is always reported as `COMPLETED`, never expired.

### Event result

`result` describes the outcome of the individual event and does not directly determine trace status.

An event with `result = ERROR` may still:

* define another expected event;
* complete the trace.

### Final-event consistency

An event with `finalEvent = true` must not define `nextExpectedEvent` or `nextEventTtlSeconds`.

Such contradictory requests return `400 Bad Request`.

### Next-event fields

`nextExpectedEvent` and `nextEventTtlSeconds` must either both be provided or both be absent.

TTL must be greater than zero.

### STARTED semantics

`STARTED` means that the trace is active, not completed, and currently has no expected next event.

It may therefore apply after more than one accepted event, not only immediately after the first event.

### Metadata

Event metadata is persisted as PostgreSQL `JSONB`.

The service does not interpret metadata for state transitions.

### Missing traces

Querying an unknown `traceId` returns `404 Not Found`.

### Consistency and concurrency

Event persistence and trace-state updates occur in one database transaction.

Database uniqueness constraints protect event IDs, and optimistic locking protects concurrent updates to the same trace.

## HTTP Response Decisions

| Situation                             |          Response |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------: |
| New event accepted                    |     `201 Created` |
| Exact duplicate accepted idempotently |          `200 OK` |
| Invalid request                       | `400 Bad Request` |
